<h1>About Me</h1>
<img src="../assets/images/Reaves Meme.png" height="200" alt="This is me most of the time" />
<p>I am Felipe, a beginner web designer. I was interested in trying to create my own website and I wanted to try and learn.
  I found this web development class by Dr. Angela Yu and so far this website shows what I have learned from her class.
</p>

<p>I like basketball, food, video games, and sleeping.</p>

<p>As I learn more about web development and create more websites, I will continue to update
  this portfolio.</p>
