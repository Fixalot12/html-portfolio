        <p>This project is a simple website where I show my top 3 movies of all-time. This is a very 
            subjective list, so please save your wild reactions. Below is a screenshot of what you 
            should expect to see on the website.

        <p>This is a virtual birthday invite I made that contains a few details such as the date and place,
            as well as a link to a google map location for the said event (the google map hyperlink is just
            an easter egg and not my actual location). Below is a screenshot of what you expect to see.
